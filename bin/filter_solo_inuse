# Filters out `solo`'s error message about an address being already in use
#  from the stderr stream.
# Solo: https://github.com/timkay/solo
# You can use this for filtering a cronjob command's output for example:
# this_script solo -port=1234 some command

# The stderr and stdout streams are switched, so `sed` can work on what was in stderr. After that, they are switched back.
